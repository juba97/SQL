table that returns employees with a last name that starts
with a lowercase English letter in the range a through
z. Remember that the collation of the sample database is case
insensitive (Latin1_General_CI_CP1_AS if you didnâ€™t 
choose an explicit collation during the SQL Server installation,
or Latin1_General_CI_AS if you chose Windows collation, Case Insensitive, Accent Sensitive) */

-- Query 1
SELECT empid, COUNT(*) AS numorders
FROM Sales.Orders

SELECT custid, orderdate, orderid, 
ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY custid ORDER BY orderdate, orderid) AS rownum
FROM Sales.Orders
ORDER BY custid, rownum;
